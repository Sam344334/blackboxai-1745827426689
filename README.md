# Samurai IDE

Welcome to the **Samurai IDE**, a simple web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides users a login interface to access coding tools directly through their browsers. This project uses a modern design with Tailwind CSS and provides a clean experience for users.

## Project Overview

The Samurai IDE is built to allow users to enter a password to gain access to a coding environment. After the user logs in with the correct password, an embedded IDE is displayed for use. The project aims to create an accessible and easily navigable interface for coding activities.

## Installation

To get started with Samurai IDE, you need to clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/samurai-ide.git
   cd samurai-ide
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

## Usage

1. Launch the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter the password `Samurai-IDE` in the password field.
3. Click "Access IDE" to proceed into the IDE environment.
4. The IDE will appear in an iframe, allowing you to start coding.

### Password Visibility Toggle

You can toggle the visibility of the password field using the eye icon in the input area.

## Features

- Clean and responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Password protection to access the IDE.
- Input field for password with visibility toggle.
- Error handling for incorrect password entries.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following external libraries:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): For styling purposes.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): To utilize the eye icons for password visibility toggle.

These dependencies are linked directly in the `index.html` file, so there's no need to install them separately.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
samurai-ide/
├── index.html         # Main HTML file for the Samurai IDE
├── styles.css         # Custom styles for the application
└── script.js          # JavaScript for handling password login and UI dynamics
```

### File Descriptions

- **index.html**: Contains the main HTML structure and links to CSS and JS files.
- **styles.css**: Custom styles to enhance the visual layout of the IDE.
- **script.js**: JavaScript functionality that manages the login behavior, including password visibility toggling and form submission.
